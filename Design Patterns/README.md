Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They help us build upon the combined experience of many developers that came before us. Another way of looking at patterns are as templates for how you solve problems - ones which can be used in quite a few different situations.

Design patterns have three main benefits:

1. They are proven solutions.
2. They can be easily reused.
3. They can be expressive. Eg: in MVC pattern there terms like Model, View, Controller and it is easy to express your concept using this vocabulary.
