The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as _types_, and one of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of types it supports.

JavaScript types can be divided into two categories:

- primitive types
- object types

### Primitive Types

Primitive types include:

- number
- string
- boolean

### object Type

Any JavaScript value that is not a number, a string, a boolean, or `null` or `undefined` is an object.

## `number`

All numbers in JavaScript are represented as 64 bit floating-point values. When a number appears directly in a JavaScript program, itâ€™s called a _numeric literal_.

```javascript
// Eg: Numeric literals
2;
3.14;
```

Any numeric literal can be preceded by a minus sign (-) to make the number negative.
