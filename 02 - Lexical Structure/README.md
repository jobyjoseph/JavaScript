Lexical structure is a set of basic rules that tell how to write a program.

## Character Set
JavaScript programs are written using the _Unicode_ character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII and Latin-1 and supports virtually every written language currently used on the planet.
```javascript
// Demo on how ES works foreign languages
const name = '\u0D1C\u0D4B\u0D2C\u0D3F';
console.log(name); // "ജോബി" My name in malayalam language
```
